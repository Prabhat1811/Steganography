STEGANOGRAPHY

1. Minimal UI using pyqt5.
2. Has a drag functonality or user can specify file.
3. Software displays the maximum amount of characters the filetype can accomodate.
4. User specifies the target location where the file is to be saved.

ALGORITHM DESIGN

1. Has some reserved bits as a signature for checking if the file was modified earlier, how many characters it has etc.
2. Initially the program will put a character at each 8th bit, the user may decrease that number to accomodate more characters.
3. Algorithms - Least Significant Bit Steganography, 
4. Username and password is required to login into the software and the username and password is used later in the image for a further security.
5. Remember these things later - *Image may be cropped later, *

THINGS TO IMPLEMENT:
1. Write test cases
2. image*
3. audio
4. video
5. document
6. drag and drop
7. open file explorer *
8. buttons*
9. show character length
10. Message line edit not moving to new line *
11. New diaglog for show message in decode section.
12. set icon *
13. Set name*
14. show dragged file name*
15. Display error messages when user has not selected a file, text is empty
16. When a file is choosen and if again choose is pressed but this time file is not choosen but the cancel button is pressed, the previous file is removed.
17.Check if application works for images sent over the internet
18. Filename, message, password vanishes when clicked the ok botton
